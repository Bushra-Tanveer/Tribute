                <h2>Einstein's greatest equation, E = mc2</h2>
                <p><b>Albert Einstein </b>14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist,[5]
                    widely
                    held to be one of the greatest and most influential scientists of all time. Best known for
                    developing the theory of relativity, he also made important contributions to quantum mechanics, and
                    was thus a central figure in the revolutionary reshaping of the scientific understanding of nature
                    that modern physics accomplished in the first decades of the twentieth century.[1][6] His
                    mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from relativity theory, has been called "the
                    world's most famous equation".[7] He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to
                    theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect",[8] a
                    pivotal step in the development of quantum theory. His work is also known for its influence on the
                    philosophy of science.[9][10] In a 1999 poll of 130 leading physicists worldwide by the British
                    journal Physics World, Einstein was ranked the greatest physicist of all time.[11] His intellectual
                    achievements and originality have made Einstein synonymous with genius</p>
