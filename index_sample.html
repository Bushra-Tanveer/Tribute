                <h2>About Tinker Bell</h2>
                <p><b>Tinker Bell </b>is a 2008 American computer-animated film and the first installment in the Disney
                    Fairies franchise produced by DisneyToon Studios. It is about Tinker Bell, a fairy character created
                    by J. M. Barrie in his 1904 play Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up, and featured in the
                    1953 Disney animated film, Peter Pan and its 2002 sequel Return to Neverland. Unlike Disney's two
                    Peter Pan films featuring the character, which were produced primarily using traditional animation,
                    Tinker Bell was produced using digital 3D modeling. The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray by Walt
                    Disney Studios Home Entertainment on October 28, 2008. A sequel, Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure,
                    was released in 2009.

                    Tinker Bell is the first Disney film to feature Tinker Bell in a speaking role. Actress Brittany
                    Murphy was originally selected for the part before the role went to Mae Whitman.[4] The film follows
                    Tinker Bell’s origin story, before she met Peter Pan, as she works out her place in Pixie Hollow and
                    struggles with what her “talent” is.
